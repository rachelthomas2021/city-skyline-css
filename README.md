## City Skyline (CSS Project)

A responsive city skyline built using pure HTML and CSS.

### Concepts practiced:
- CSS variables
- Flexbox layouts
- Linear & repeating gradients
- Layering with foreground/background elements
- Media queries for responsive design

This project has helped improve my understanding of layout structure
and visual problem-solving using only CSS (no images) I used repeating gradients to create windows, layered all foreground and background shapes, used flexboxes to develope layout, etc..
